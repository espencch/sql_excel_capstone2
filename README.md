Description:
The penal population in Singapore refers to the number of individuals incarcerated in prisons and other correctional facilities in the country. Here is an overview of the history of the penal population in Singapore from 2012 to 2020:

In 2012, the total penal population in Singapore was 13,328, with a incarceration rate of 236 per 100,000 population.

In 2013, the total penal population increased to 13,539, with a incarceration rate of 240 per 100,000 population.

In 2014, the total penal population decreased slightly to 13,389, with a incarceration rate of 235 per 100,000 population.

In 2015, the total penal population decreased further to 12,958, with a incarceration rate of 226 per 100,000 population.

In 2016, the total penal population increased slightly to 13,017, with a incarceration rate of 226 per 100,000 population.

In 2017, the total penal population increased to 13,338, with a incarceration rate of 230 per 100,000 population.

In 2018, the total penal population decreased to 12,772, with a incarceration rate of 217 per 100,000 population.

In 2019, the total penal population decreased further to 11,872, with a incarceration rate of 199 per 100,000 population.

In 2020, the total penal population decreased to 10,855, with a incarceration rate of 180 per 100,000 population.

The decrease in the penal population from 2015 to 2020 can be attributed to various initiatives and policies implemented by the Singaporean government to reduce crime and recidivism rates, such as the introduction of community-based programs and alternative sentencing options. However, the penal population in Singapore still remains relatively high compared to other developed countries.
